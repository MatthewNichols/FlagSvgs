## Freshly "drawn" vector images of flags I like

Roman Mars's Ted Talk [Why City Flags May Be the Worst Designed Thing You've Never Noticed](https://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed) caused me to extend my already developing obession with design into the world of flags. As I am training myself in the domain of electronic art reproducing some of the flags I find in the world is a great set of practice problems. If they are amusing or useful to you enjoy them.

Legalish stuff: Unless I run into notices to the contrary I am assuming that flags out in the world are in the public domain. I am attaching a copy of the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) to the repository. I make NO warranty as to the copyright status of any of the source material, but I will not knowingly include any flags that are under non-open licenses. But please do you own due dilligance before using.
